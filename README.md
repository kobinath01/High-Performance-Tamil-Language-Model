The increasing demand for advanced natural language processing (NLP) applications in
 Tamil poses a significant challenge due to the limitations of existing models, particularly
 in the context of underrepresented languages. Current large language models (LLMs),
 predominantly trained on English and other widely spoken languages, often exhibit sub
optimal performance when applied to Tamil. This gap is exacerbated by the specific
 linguistic characteristics of Tamil, such as its complex syntax, rich morphology, and di
verse dialects, which are not fully addressed by existing models.
 Traditional NLP models and techniques, constrained by limited training data and
 linguistic resources, struggle to capture the nuanced linguistic patterns and contextual
 dependencies present in Tamil. This results in inadequate performance in key applications
 such as text generation, machine translation, and sentiment analysis.
 Deep learning approaches, particularly LLMs, offer a compelling alternative by lever
aging vast amounts of data and advanced architectures to model complex language pat
terns. However, the application of these models to Tamil remains limited, primarily due
 to challenges such as data scarcity, high computational costs, and the need for tailored
 adaptations to handle the unique features of the Tamil language.
 The problem, therefore, is to develop a small yet high-performance language model
 specifically for Tamil that can effectively capture its linguistic intricacies while being
 optimized for deployment on mobile devices. This involves overcoming challenges related
 to:
 Data Availability: Limited high-quality Tamil text corpora compared to more widely
 spoken languages. Computational Constraints: Efficiently training and deploying models
 with limited resources on small devices. Model Adaptation: Tailoring model architectures
 to address the specific linguistic and contextual needs of Tamil, while maintaining a small
 footprint suitable for mobile applications. By addressing these challenges, this research
 aims to contribute to the development of a robust and efficient Tamil NLP model that
 advances low-resource language processing and enhances the accessibility and accuracy
 of Tamil-language applications on mobile platforms
